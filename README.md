# 😷 Face Mask Detection – Real-Time Computer Vision App

A real-time face mask detection system using deep learning and computer vision. This project identifies individuals wearing or not wearing masks through webcam video streams, helping enforce public health protocols.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 Detects faces and classifies whether a person is wearing a mask.
- 📹 Real-time video feed analysis via webcam.
- ⚙️ Deep learning model trained on image datasets with high accuracy.
- 📦 Built using OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, and Python.
- 🔍 High detection precision with low false positives.
